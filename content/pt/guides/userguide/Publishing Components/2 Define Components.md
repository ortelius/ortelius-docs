## _Component_ List View allows Adding or Deleting

Use the _Component_ List View accessible from the left hand _Component_ menu option to manage your _Components Base Version_ and _Component Versions_. Because each _Environment_ has a row where the _Component Base Version_ or _Component Version_ has been deployed, there can be multiple entries for the same _Component_ if it has been deployed to multiple _Environments_. A list of all _Components_ is organized by the following:

| List Column                        | Description                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Version**                        | The _Component Base Version_ or _Component Version_ number.                                                                             |
| **Domain**                         | The _Domain_ to which the _Component_ belongs.                                                                                          |
| **Parent**                         | The _Component Base Version_ from which the _Component Version_ was created. This will be empty for the _Component Base Version_.       |
| **Environment**                    | The _Environment_ to which the _Component_ has been deployed. Each _Environment_ will represent a different row in the List View table. |
| **Last Deployment to Environment** | The Deployment Log number.                                                                                                              |
| **Completed**                      | The date and time of the last deployment to the listed _Environment_.                                                                   |
| **Results**                        | Success or Fail.                                                                                                                        |

Note: If you have not defined any _Components_ to Ortelius, you will see only the sample data.

You can also use the Filter bar, represented by a funnel icon, to reorder your _Component_ List View:

- Domain
- Environment
- Last Deployment
- Parent
- Result
- Version

## How to View and Edit _Components_

_Components_ are defined as Container, Application File, or Database.  These are the different types of _Components_ you may need from microservices to binaries and DB updates. The Dashboard view displays all information related to a specific _Component Base Version_ or _Component Version_. Depending on what type of _Component_ you are defining, you will be presented with different data definition fields.

The following fields are common to all _Components_:

| Field                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## _Endpoints_

This section lists all _Endpoints_ that the _Component_ has been installed to with its Deployment Number. The Deployment Number is generated by Ortelius for each unique deployment.  You can also use this section to stop incremental deployments and force a specific version to be deployed to the _Endpoint_. By manually adding a specific _Component Version_ to the _Endpoint_, you bypass the incremental deployment logic of the deployment engine.  For example, if you would like to deploy a particular container without accepting any intermediate updates, you would go to the intermediate _Component Versions_ and manually add them to the _Endpoints_, causing the deployment engine to believe that it was previously deployed. When you manually add an _Endpoint_, the Deployment Number will show "manually deployed." To manually add a _Component_ to an _Endpoint_, use the +Add option. You will be provided a list of available _Endpoints_. Use Save to commit the change to the table. You can select multiple _Endpoints_.  To Edit or Delete an _Endpoint_, select the _Endpoint_ and use the Edit or Delete option.

## Deployed Environments for _Component_

A map showing all _Environments_ where the _Component_ is deployed.

## Consuming _Applications_

This section shows a list of all _Applications_ that are consuming this _Component_.

## Component Readme

Give your users more information about your Container, Application File or Database Component. You can upload an external readme file to provide any information that you need to convey to your potential consumers. Use the 'Upload' option to select a file. It must be in text format. You can also automate the upload - see below.

## Component Swagger

Publish your Swagger API definitions to provide further information about your restful APIs and the parameters needed. Ortelius takes your .json or .yaml file and renders it using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). Use the 'Upload' option to associate your .json or .yaml file to that specific _Component Version_. You can also automate the upload - see below.

## Component SBOM

Publish your Component's SBOM to show packages and licenses your Component is consuming. SBOMs are required for populating the CVEs.

## Component Vulnerabilities  

Component vulnerabilities are based on your SBOM. Every thirty minutes, Ortelius updates the Component vulnerabilities based on OSV.Dev. For more information refer to [OSV.Dev section](/guides/userguide/integrations/osvdev/) of this documentation.

## Component License

Report the license associated with your code base for your _Component_. Use the 'Upload' option to import your License file into Ortelius. The file must be in a text format.

## Automate the Readme, SBOM, License, and Swagger Upload via Your Pipeline

You can automatically upload you readme, SBOM, License, and Swagger data using the Command Line Interface (CLI) added to your pipeline. For more information review the [CI/CD CLI details](https://github.com/ortelius/ortelius-cli/blob/main/doc/dh.md). You will find a complete list of parameters for collecting Swagger, SBOM and other tool reports and results. .

### Access

The Access Section allows _Users_ within designated _Groups_ to update or view the _Component_. To add a _Group_ to one of the access lists, drag and drop the _Group_ from the Available Groups list onto desired access list. All _Users_ who belong to a _Group_ that appear in one of the Access lists will be granted access to the _Component_:

| Access     | Description                                                                                                       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **View**   | This allows any _User_ that belongs to any _Group_ in this list to see the selected _Component_ in the List View. |
| **Change** | This allows any _User_ that belongs to any _Group_ in this list to make changes to the _Component_.               |

## Publish a New _Component Version_ Based on an Existing _Component Version_

Create _Component Versions_ that are patterned after the _Component Base Version_ or any _Component Version_. Check the box _Component Base Version_ or _Component Versions_ from which you want to base the new version. Select the New Version Tab to access the _Component_ Dashboard and then edit the new _Component Version_. When you manually create a new _Component Version_ the name will be auto generated with a new number. You may need to provide it a unique name based on your versioning patterns.

## Publish New _Component Versions_ automatically via Continuous Delivery

Configure a continuous delivery system to automatically update new _Component Versions_ each time a new GitCommit triggers the workflow process.  Add Ortelius to the workflow to perform the continuous versioning of new _Components_ and their consuming _Applications_.  For more information, see [Using Ortelius with CI/CD](/guides/userguide/integrations/ci-cd_integrations/).

## _Component_ Dependency Map

The Dependency Map provides a graphical view of all _Applications_ that is consuming this _Component_. This will remain empty until your  _Component_ is used by an an _Application_.
