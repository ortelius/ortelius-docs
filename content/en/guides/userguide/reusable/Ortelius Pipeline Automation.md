## Adding Continuous Security Intelligence to your DevOps Pipeline 

In order to continuously gather pipeline intelligence, Ortelius must become part of the pipeline. Ortelius integrates with Jenkins, or other CI/CD process engines using the Ortelius Command Line (CLI). The Ortelius CLI gathers supply chain data based on a single pipeline workflow at the build and deploy steps. The build step gathers Swagger, SBOM, Readme, licenses, Git data, Docker image, and other build output. The deploy step records when a release occurs, what was sent and where the objects were sent to.

For the most up to date information on the Ortelius CLI visit the [Ortelius GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ortelius/ortelius-cli/blob/main/doc/dh.md). You will find a complete list of parameters for collecting Swagger, SBOM and other tool reports and results.

[Install](/guides/userguide/installation-and-support/0-commandlineinterface/) the Ortelius CLI where your CI/CD server is running.


### Ortelius Data Gathering using .toml

The Ortelius CLI reads from a .toml file. The .toml file contains non-derived information for each artifact that you create at your build step. In Ortelius, an artifact is referred to as a _Component_.  A _Component_ is a Container, DB Object, or file object (.jar, Lamda Function, Apex file, etc.). The .toml file will provide the 'non-derived' data for the _Component_ your are tracking in Ortelius which includes the _Component_ name, owner, _Component type_, and owner contact details.  The Ortelius CLI will read the .toml file from the Git Repository associated to your pipeline. If you are using a Mono Repository for your entire codebase, you will need a separate Component.toml file for each _Component_, managed in sub-directories.

Once created, your .toml file does not need to be updated unless the non-derived information changes, or you want to reorganize to which Applications or _Domains_ the Component has been assigned. For example, a Component has been reassigned to a new owner and new team represented by a _Domain_ or _Application_.

#### Variable Resolution

The ${VARIABLE} syntax represents an environment variable or derived variable that will be resolved at execution time.  In the below example in Step 2, ${GIT_TAG} is a variable that will be derived by the CLI from git.  The derived value will be inserted in to the ${GIT_TAG} variable placeholders.

##### Derived Variables

#### Perform the following steps to add your _Components_ using the .toml file

##### Step 1 - Define Your Pipeline Variables

The following variables should be set at the beginning of your Pipeline.

| Variable   | Value                            | Description                                                                             |
|------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DHURL      | URL to Ortelius Login            | The URL used to access Ortelius.                                                        |
| DHUSER     | UserID                           | The ID used to log into Ortelius                                                        |
| DHPASS     | password                         | The password used to log into Ortelius. This can encrypted based on the CI/CD solution. |
| DOCKERREPO | Name of your Docker Repository   | For Components that are Docker Images. Not needed for non-docker objects.               |
| IMAGE_TAG  | Tag for the Docker Image if used | For Components that are Docker Images. Not needed for non-docker objects.               |

Example

```bash
export DHURL=https://console.ortelius.com
export DHUSER=Stella99
export DHPASS=chasinghorses
export DOCKERREPO=quay.io/ortelius/hello-world
export IMAGE_TAG=1.0.0
```

#### Step 2 - Create your Component.toml file

Cut and paste the following into a component.toml file, update 'your' information, and commit/push it to your Git Repository.

```toml
# Application Name and Version - not required. If not used the Component will not be associated to an Application
Application = "GLOBAL."your Application Name"
Application_Version = "your Application Version" 

# Define Component Name, Variant and Version - required
Name = "GLOBAL.your Component Name"
Variant = "${GIT_BRANCH}"
Version = "vyour Component Version.${BUILD_NUM}-g${SHORT_SHA}"

# Key/Values to associate to the Component Version
[Attributes]
    DockerBuildDate = "${BLDDATE}"
    DockerRepo = "${DOCKERREPO}"
    DockerSha = "${DIGEST}"
    DockerTag = "${IMAGE_TAG}"
    DiscordChannel = "your Discord channel" or SlackChannel = "your Slack Channel" 
    ServiceOwner = "${DHUSER}"
    ServiceOwnerEmail = "your Component Owner Email"
```

For example:

```toml
# Application Name and Version
Application = "GLOBAL.Santa Fe Software.Online Store Company.Hipster Store.Prod.helloworld app"
Application_Version = "1" 

# Define Component Name, Variant and Version
Name = "GLOBAL.Santa Fe Software.Online Store Company"
Variant = "${GIT_BRANCH}"
Version = "v1.0.0.${BUILD_NUM}-g${SHORT_SHA}"


# Key/Values to associate to the Component Version
[Attributes]
    DockerBuildDate = "${BLDDATE}"
    DockerRepo = "${DOCKERREPO}"
    DockerSha = "${DIGEST}"
    DockerTag = "${IMAGE_TAG}"
    DiscordChannel = "https://discord.gg/wM4b5yEFzS"
    ServiceOwner= "${DHUSER}"
    ServiceOwnerEmail = "stella@chasinghorses.io"

```

>Note: For SaaS users, you will have a second high-level qualifier that was created as part of your sign-up. This second high-level qualifier must be used as the start of your Application Name and Component Name.  For example: _GLOBAL.Santa Fe Software.Online Store_.

>Note: Component Versioning Schema - A more advanced Component Version Schema is represented by the 'Version" variable. This Variable will allow you to define a custom component versioning schema to suit your organizations requirements.

| Variable | Value          | Description                  |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Version  | Version String | Your Required Version Schema |

Example:
```
Version = "v1.0.0.${BUILD_NUM}-g${SHORT_SHA}"
```


#### Step 3 - Add a step in your pipeline to run Syft if you are not generating SBOMS (Optional)
Ortelius can consume any SPDX and CycloneDX formatted SBOM. If you are already generating SBOMs, you will pass the name of the SBOM results to Ortelius is step 4 below. If you are not generating SBOMs as part of your pipeline process, you will need to add SBOM generation to collect the lower dependency data. Following is how to add Syft to your workflow to include the collection of SBOM data.

[Syft SBOM tool](https://github.com/anchore/syft) will generate Software Bill of Material Reports for popular coding languages and package managers, including Docker images.

The following code example scans a Docker Image to generate the SBOM.  See [Syft Options](https://github.com/anchore/syft#supported-sources) to scan other objects and coding languages.

```bash
# install Syft
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/syft/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $PWD

# create the SBOM
./syft packages $DOCKERREPO:$IMAGE_TAG --scope all-layers -o cyclonedx-json > cyclonedx.json

# display the SBOM
cat cyclonedx.json
```

#### Step 4 - Run the Ortelius CLI to add Your Component and Create an Application

>Note: To complete the process you will need to install the Ortelius CLI where your CI/CD server is running. Refer to the [Ortelius GitHub CLI Documentation](https://github.com/ortelius/ortelius-cli/blob/main/doc/dh.md) for installation instructions.

Execute the following calls to the Ortelius CLI as part of your workflow. It should be called after the build and SBOM generation:

With CycloneDX SBOM

```bash
dh updatecomp --rsp component.toml --deppkg "cyclonedx@name of your SBOM file"

Example:
dh updatecomp --rsp component.toml --deppkg "cyclonedx@cyclonedx.json"
```
With SPDX SBOM

```bash
dh updatecomp --rsp component.toml --deppkg "spdx@name of your SBOM file. "

Example:
dh updatecomp --rsp component.toml --deppkg "spdx@spdx.json"
```
Without SBOM

```bash
dh updatecomp --rsp component.toml 
```

## Results using the CLI in your CI/CD pipeline

### Application to Component Dependencies
Select Your Application from the ‘Application View.’ It should show you one Component as a dependency.

## Recording DORA Metrics for Deployment

Recording deployment frequency and lead time to change provides needed Dora Metrics. This can be done via the CI/CD integration. The output from the deployment can be passed to the CLI to be persisted with the _Application Version_ and _Component Versions_. 

The CLI accepts a json file that defines the _Application Version_, _Environment_ and deployment return code. The _Application Version_ is an existing application version that was created manually or earlier in your pipeline. The _Environment_ the environment, Dev, QA or Prod, that the _Application Version_ was deployed to.  The deployment return code is 0 for successful deployment or 1 for failed deployment.

#### Deploy.json File

```json
{
 "application": "GLOBAL.Online Store Company.Hipster Store.Test.Hipster Store;Labor Day Sale;1_2_10_2",
 "environment": "GLOBAL.Online Store Company.Hipster Store.qa3-windows",
 "rc": 0
}
```

#### Running the CLI

The following variables should be set at the beginning of your Pipeline.

| Variable | Value                  | Description                                                                              |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DHURL    | URL to Ortelius Login | The URL used to access Ortelius.                                                        |
| DHUSER   | UserID                 | The ID used to log into Ortelius                                                       |
| DHPASS   | password               | The password used to log into Ortelius. This can encrypted based on the CI/CD solution. |

Example

```bash
export DHURL=https://deployhub.example.com
export DHUSER=Stella99
export DHPASS=password
```

```bash
dh deploy --deploydata deploy.json --logdeployment
```

#### Results

In the Ortelius dashboard, navigate to the _Application_ list view.  You will see that the _Application Version_ has been deployed to
_Environment_ with a _Deployment_ number.  The _Deployment_ number is generated by the CLI.  

The Deployment Frequency report is accessible by selecting an _Application Version_ in the list view, then menu item `Reports -> Deployment Frequency`.

![Deployment Frequency](/guides/userguide/images/deploymentfrequency.png)

The data time the top and bottom graphs are the same but use different visualizations in order to under the the Deployment Frequency.

The graphs are interactive, so float-overs and clicking on the labels will highlight and filter the data.
