  Take a Tour of Continuous Security Intelligence
---
To help you understand the need for continuously monitoring your security intelligence, Ortelius has provided a free version with a tutorial for you to explore. This free version is based on the Ortelius.io open-source project incubating at the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation), hosted by DeployHub, Inc. Explore how the Ortelius _Application_ is configured and walk through basic concepts of Continuous Security Intelligence.

![Ortelius Hosted by DeployHub](/guides/userguide/images/HostedLogo-SignIn.png)

The Ortelius project uses a decoupled microservices architecture serving as a great example of how Continuous Security Intelligence unifies fragmented clues and forensics across _Components_ to expose the _Application_ level security posture. In this tutorial you will see how Ortelius aggregates _Component_ level security to the _Application_ level providing comprehensive security insights at the  _Application_ level:
- SBOMs
- real-time vulnerability reports
- compliance reports

You will also see how Ortelius uses a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to organize data across teams.

## Signing Up and Getting Started

When you [signup for Ortelius](https://www.deployhub.com/deployhub-team/), you are asked for required information, your Company, Project names, first name, lastname, email and UserID/Password. Your UserID/Password and Company name are unique.  Your Project will be a _Subdomain_ under your Company _Domain_.

Ortelius is accessible through the following url:

[https://console.deployhub.com/dmadminweb/Home](https://console.deployhub.com/dmadminweb/Home)

Login using the UserID and Password you used when you signed up for Ortelius. 

Upon logging into Ortelius, you will be given an option to select your Company Name Domain, or the Open Source Domain. The Open Source Domain is prepopulated with data so you can take a tour.  Select the Open Source Domain to start exploring.

## Explore Domains

_Domains_ serve as the basic structure of organizing Continuous Security Intelligence. Developers use _Domains_ to catalog their _Components_ based on 'solution spaces.' Organizing your software supply chain in this way allows for _Components_ to be easily shared.

_Domains_ are not folders. They serve as a method for creating fully qualified names of Objects within Ortelius to keep things organized.  _Domains_ also manage security and Tasks.  When you assign security options and Tasks at the _Domain_ level, any child _Subdomain_ inherits the value. A child _Subdomain_ can override a parent _Domain_ value.

You can explore the _GLOBAL.open source_ Domain to learn how Continuous Security Intelligence is organized.  In Ortelius terminology, the _GLOBAL.open source_ Domain has multiple _Subdomains_.

1) From the left hand side menu, select _Domains_. This will take you to the _Domain_ Details. All _Domains_ you have access to will be shown in the _Domain_ List Box.

2) Select GLOBAL.Open Source.Linux Foundation. In the Details, you will see this _Domain_ has two _Subdomains_, the CDF and the OpenSSF. Navigating through the GLOBAL.Open Source.Linux Foundation.CDF _Domain_ will reveal that the Ortelius project is a _Sub-Domain_ of the CDF.

For More information on Domains see - [Building _Domains_](/guides/userguide/definedomains/)

## Explore Components

_Components_ are artifacts, binaries, files or any deployable artifact. _Components_ are assigned to _Applications_. This assignment allows for the aggregation of data from the _Components_ to the _Applications_ that consume them, providing unified Software Bill of Materials reports and Application Security Posture reports.  

### Using the Component List View

From the left hand side menu, select "_Components_". This will take you to a list of view of all _Components_ assigned to the selected _Domain_. Using the filter option, choose _GLOBAL.Open Source.Linux Foundation.CDF.Ortelius_ to view all of the _Components_ consumed by the Ortelius open source project.

<strong><u>SBOM and Vulnerabilities</u></strong>

When you view a _Components_ details, the first attribute you will see is the _Component's_ Software Bill of Materials and real-time vulnerabilities.

When your _Component_ build executes, Ortelius will generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) report using the CI/CD command line integration (CLI). Once gathered, Ortelius cross references the SBOM results to known vulnerabilities in real-time. While the SBOM is a static view, the vulnerabilities are updated regularly. Ortelius continuously scans [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/) for new known vulnerabilities for all the packages in the SBOM.

In this view, you will see the _Component's_ SBOM displayed with the Package, Version, License and OpenSSF Scorecard values.

<p><br></p>

>Note: You can export a _Component's_ Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Report by returning to the _Component_ list view, check mark the _Component_ and select _Export SBOM_ from the top navigation menu. You will be a provided a full view of your _Components_ SBOM to be shared across teams.



![Component SBOM](/guides/userguide/images/SBOM-component.jpg)

<p><br></p>

<strong><u>OpenSSF ScoreCard</u></strong>

Ortelius uses the GitRepo and GitCommit from the the CI/CD command line integration (CLI) to gather OpenSSF scorecard data. When available, you will see the _Components_ compliance with OpenSSF scorecard.

![Components Scorecard](/guides/userguide/images/componentOpenSSFSC.jpg)
