  Installing Ortelius On-premise

## On Premise Installation Prerequisites

Ortelius runs in a Docker Container with all required dependencies, such as Postgresql.  Docker is the only prerequisite for your on premise installation of Ortelius.  If you do not have Docker, below are steps for building a Docker environment.

### Docker Installation Guides

- [Docker for CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)
- [Docker for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Docker for Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)
- [Docker for RedHat](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/getting_started_with_containers/index)
- [Docker for OS/X](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

### Test your Docker Install

See the [Docker Install Test](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#test-docker-version) instructions

## Installing Your Ortelius Docker Image

The Ortelius Docker Image is found on the Redhat Quay Docker Registry. Follow the steps below to install the Ortelius into your Docker installation.

### Step 1 - Pull Ortelius from Redhat Quay Registry

Run:

~~~bash
docker pull quay.io/ortelius/ortelius:latest
~~~

### Step 2 - Create a directory to persist the Postgres database

Run:

~~~bash
mkdir -p ~/ortelius/data
~~~

### Step 3 - Find your image SHA

Run:

~~~bash
docker images | grep ortelius | grep latest
~~~

Find the image SHA from the third column in the output.

~~~bash
quay.io/ortelius/ortelius          latest          0114088b0b44        6 days ago          3.32GB
~~~

The SHA in the above example is 0114088b0b44.

### Step 4 - Start the container for Linux and OS/X

Use the image SHA from Step 3 as the last parameter to the docker run.

~~~bash
docker run -v ~/ortelius/data:/var/lib/pgsql/data:Z -v ~/ortelius/logs:/opt/ortelius/logs:Z -p 7171:8080 -d â€“hostname quay.io/ortelius/ortelius -v ~/.ssh:/keys:Z 0114088b0b44
~~~

### Step 5 - Access Ortelius from your browser

 Ortelius is accessible through the following url:

Your Ortelius DNS name is the server where you installed Ortelius.

```bash
http://<Ortelius DNS name>:7171/dmadminweb/Home
```

As the first user to use the new install, you will be prompted to setup the administrator user id and password.

## The Hipster Store Tutorial

The Hipster Store Tutorial is not available in the on-premise installation.  If you would like to go through the Hipster Store Tutorial, you should [sign up](/userguide/installation-and-support/0-saas-and-reverse-proxy/) for the SaaS environment. This example gives you a review of _Domains_, _Components_, and _Applications_ and will help you understand Ortelius basic concepts.
